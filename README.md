Go Debouncer is a Go language library. It makes sure that the pre-defined function is only triggered once per client's signals during a fixed duration.

It allows creating a debouncer that delays invoking a triggered function until after the duration has elapsed since the last time the SendSingal was invoked.

# Quickstart

Import library to your project

```bash
go get -u github.com/vnteamopen/godebouncer
```

From your code, you can try to create debouncer.

```go
package main

func main() {
	wait := 5 * time.Second
	debouncer := godebouncer.New(wait).WithTriggered(func() {
		fmt.Println("Trigger") // Triggered func will be called after 10 seconds from last SendSignal().
	})

	fmt.Println("Action 1")
	debouncer.SendSignal()

	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

	fmt.Println("Action 2")
	debouncer.SendSignal()
	// After 5 seconds, the trigger will be called.
	// Previous `SendSignal()` will be ignored to trigger the triggered function.

	time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
}
```

# Anything else?

## Do

Allows defining actions before calling SendSignal(). They are synchronous.

```go
wait := 10 * time.Second
debouncer := godebouncer.New(wait).WithTriggered(func() {
	fmt.Println("Trigger") // Triggered func will be called after 10 seconds from last SendSignal().
})

debouncer.Do(func() {
	fmt.Println("Action 1")
})
// Debouncer run the argument function of Do() then SendSignal(). They run sequentially.
// After 10 seconds from finishing Do(), the triggered function will be called.
```

## Cancel

Allows cancelling the timer from the last function SendSignal(). The scheduled triggered function is cancelled and doesn't invoke.

```go
wait := 10 * time.Second
debouncer := godebouncer.New(wait).WithTriggered(func() {
	fmt.Println("Trigger") // Triggered func will be called after 10 seconds from last SendSignal().
})

debouncer.SendSignal()
debouncer.Cancel() // No triggered function is called
```

## Update triggered function

Allows replacing triggered function.

```go
wait := 10 * time.Second
debouncer := godebouncer.New(wait).WithTriggered(func() {
	fmt.Println("Trigger 1") // Triggered func will be called after 10 seconds from last SendSignal().
})

debouncer.SendSignal()
debouncer.UpdateTriggeredFunc(func() {
	fmt.Println("Trigger 2")
})

// Output: "Trigger 2" after 10 seconds
```

## Update waiting time duration

Allows replacing the waiting time duration. You need to call a SendSignal() again to trigger a new timer with a new waiting time duration.

```go
wait := 10 * time.Second
debouncer := godebouncer.New(wait).WithTriggered(func() {
	fmt.Println("Trigger") // Triggered func will be called after 10 seconds from last SendSignal().
})

debouncer.UpdateTimeDuration(20 * time.Millisecond)
debouncer.SendSignal()
// Output: "Trigger" after 20 seconds
```
